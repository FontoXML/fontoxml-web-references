## Usage of the open-web-reference-modal-for-insert/edit

The {@link operation/open-web-reference-modal-for-insert} and {@link operation/open-web-reference-modal-for-edit} operations are used to open the web reference modal. The modal allows the user to insert a new web reference or edit an existing web reference.

For more information, see the {@link operation/open-web-reference-modal-for-insert} and {@link operation/open-web-reference-modal-for-edit} operations.

## Usage of the WebReferencePopover

The WebReferencePopover popover is used to show more information about a web reference.

This popover can be used by configuring an element to use this popover. See the {@link Creating a popover} guide for more information.
